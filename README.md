# ContactManager
Options assignment to create a command line Contact Manager

This is to practice using HashMaps and other classes and other data structures together.
Note that there is no real error checking in this. If you do something unexpected the program will crash. 

I'm just trying to make the logic work, if I can get through that and I have time I will go back in and put in error handling.
